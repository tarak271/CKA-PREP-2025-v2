Question 2 | MinIO Operator, CRD Config, Helm Install

Solve this question on the local cluster.

Install the MinIO Operator using Helm in *Namespace* minio. Then configure and create the *Tenant* CRD:

1. Create *Namespace* minio  
2. Install Helm chart minio/operator into the new *Namespace*. The Helm Release should be called minio-operator  
3. Update the Tenant resource in /opt/course/2/minio-tenant.yaml to include enableSFTP: true under features  
4. Create the Tenant resource from /opt/course/2/minio-tenant.yaml  
    

ℹ️ It is not required for MinIO to run properly. Installing the Helm Chart and the *Tenant* resource as requested is enough

Course files are under /opt/course/2/
